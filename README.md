# MobiMon (Remote Mobility Monitoring)
Currently, there is no widely used mobility monitoring solution that can be used on a daily basis. Essentially, people’s metrics are shared only during weekly or monthly checkups and most often, require synchronous meetings with the patients. The CIC’s goal with this project is to tackle this problem for organizations in our community and allow for daily mobility monitoring without the need for synchronous meetings with the patient. Its impact on the community would include, but not be limited to, allowing more personalized and more frequent care for mobility-impaired patients.
